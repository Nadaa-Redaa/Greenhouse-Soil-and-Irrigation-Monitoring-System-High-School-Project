# Greenhouse Soil and Irrigation Monitoring System (High School Project)
The major obstacle Egypt faces in becoming more efficient is managing and utilizing modern technologies to improve humansâ€™ life, specifically through the development of an intelligent greenhouse aimed at optimizing crop growth year-round. The project implements Multi-Sensor Integration, allowing for continuous monitoring of essential parameters such as soil moisture linked to a water pump for moisture regulation, light intensity which triggers a buzzer if light level exceeds requirements, temperature monitoring, and air quality sensors that detect CO2 concentration variations between day and night. The system is designed to provide real-time data updates every 30 seconds to ensure optimal conditions for plants. A Bluetooth terminal interface provides a user-friendly digital platform for non-technical users, and the greenhouse stores data for up to a year through Tera Term, transferring it to Excel sheets. Alerts notify users when environmental thresholds are breached, enhancing responsiveness. Additionally, the sensors are powered by a battery designed to last a minimum of six months without replacement, supporting sustainability. The battery is supported by renewable energy sources to extend its lifetime. In conclusion, the integration of a soil moisture sensor with a water pump addresses soil dryness and excessive water consumption, contributing to efficiency.
